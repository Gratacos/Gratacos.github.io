I am a PhD candidate at Washington University in St Louis, where I am studying computational geometry under the mentorship of [Professor Tao Ju](https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/). My interests lie on constructing novel algorithms with applications graphics, geometry, and imaging. My CV can be found [here][1].

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where I studied in the University of Puerto Rico, RÃ­o Piedras Campus. From my love of its urban music, wildlife and nature, to my interest in Computer Science, this island has defined and made me the person I am today.

Outside of my professional life, I love playing video games, hiking, and wildlife photography. Make sure to follow me on Instagram at [gratacosgustavo](https://www.instagram.com/gratacosgustavo/) to follow my hiking/wildlife photos!
