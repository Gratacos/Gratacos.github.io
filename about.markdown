I am a computer scientist that just graduated from Washington University in St Louis, where I studied computational geometry under the mentorship of [Professor Tao Ju](https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/). My interests lie on constructing novel algorithms with applications graphics, geometry, and imaging. My résumé can be found [here][1].

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, where I studied in the University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus. From my love of its urban music, wildlife and nature, to my interest in Computer Science, this island has defined and made me the person I am today.

Outside of my professional life, I love playing video games, hiking, and wildlife photography. Make sure to follow me on Instagram at [gratacosgustavo](https://www.instagram.com/gratacosgustavo/) to follow my hiking/wildlife photos!
