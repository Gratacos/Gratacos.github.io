# Hiking 

I’m an avid hiker. Even though I’m currently car-less in St. Louis, I always take the opportunity to hike with friends or in my vacations. There is something about being away from society while remaining energized in a calm, but serene environment that is unparalleled by any other activity. Not to mention that it provides ample opportunities to find wildlife and landscapes to photograph.

# Photography

I love wildlife and landscape photography. Wildlife conservation is very important to me. Moreover, the hobby is fun. Photographing rare animals and good views of nature is challenging and rewarding, and it provides a means for me to document the trips and adventures I go on. It almost reminds me of playing “pokemon snap” as a kid!

Above are some of my photos of 8 of the 14 extant species of Puerto Rican _coquíes_. I hope to one day see all of them. Unfortunately, due to the critically endangered status of many of them, that may not be possible.
