# Tree Recovery by Dynamic Programming

![Foto](/assets/tree-recovery.png){: width="500" }

There are many tree-like objects in nature: retinal blood vessels, plant roots, lung airways, etc. It is often desirable to analyze the structure of these objects from images, volumes, or point-clouds by obtaining a *skeleton* from these images. Unfortunately, these skeletons often contain unwanted cycles due to various issues throughout the imaging and skeletonization process. 

We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for solving the NP-hard tree-recovery problem for retrieving an acyclic skeleton from these cyclic graphs. This work is published in [IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197214).

# Plant Segmentation with Graph Cuts 

![Foto](/assets/plant-segmentation.gif){: width="500" }

For this work, we made a UI to segment a series of overhead images of plant, with the constraint that each segmentation must be consistent with the next. This tool also allows you to select a region of interest, and to manually “clean up” the resulting segmentation. This work is openly available in GitHub [here](https://github.com/ayanc/plseg).

We presented this work in the 2021 _Annual North American Plant Phenotyping Network Conference_ in the poster: “Temporally Consistent Multi-label Plant-level Segmentation of Overhead Images for High-throughput Phenotyping.” Furthermore, this UI was created as part of the work published in: [The plant response to high CO2 levels is heritable and orchestrated by DNA methylation](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18876).

# Image Denoising 

In 2018, I participated in the [WUSEF](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/undergraduate-research/WUSEF.html) summer program at Washington University in St. Louis with Ulugbek Kamilov’s [Computational Imaging Group](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/ulugbek-s-kamilov/).

I worked on denoising images using _Patch-wise Sparse Learning_ for the Computational Imaging Group’s comparative results in denoising, and use in their lab for future work.

# MUzECS: Teaching Programming via Music

![Foto](/assets/circuit-playground.jpeg){: width="500" }

In 2017, I participated in an undergraduate summer research experience at Marquette University under the mentorship of [Professor Dennis Brylow](https://reu.cs.mu.edu/index.php/User:Brylow). For this project, we worked on _MUzECS_, an educational platform that includes:
 * A circuit board that can make music.
 * An easy to use, visual, block-based programming language for this circuit board. 
The aim of this project was to get this platform to work with [adafruit’s](https://www.adafruit.com/) Circuit Playground board in a way to maximize ease of use, while teaching students the fundamentals of programming.
