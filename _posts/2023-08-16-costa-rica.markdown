I’m finishing up my trip to Costa Rica, reflecting on the great time I’ve had, and going through all the photos I’ve taken!

# San Gerardo de Dota 

Our first destination was San Gerardo de Dota: a small, cool, and cloudy town in the Río Savegre Valley. My reasons for picking this destination: 
 * It boasts cool temperatures and moody, cloudy climates, which are great for cabin life! Reminds me of staying in cool, mountain cabins at Maricao, back in my home in Puerto Rico. 
 * It is known for birding. This area is known to be a good location to spot Resplendent Quetzals and an immense number of hummingbird species. 
 * It is near peaks that contain the *Costa Rican páramo* biome: a beautiful and mystical ecosystem, only found in high elevations, that contains small and unique vegetation.

The cabin itself had many species of recurring hummingbirds and woodpeckers and beautiful views of the milky way galaxy when the sky was clear. Our place was also near *Miriam’s Quetzals*, a beautiful restaurant with great Casados and delicious Papayas Chilenas! The restaurant has a back porch with beautiful views of the valley, a hummingbird feeder with more species of hummingbird than I’ve ever seen in my life, and a wild avocado tree which had some Resplendent Quetzals that frequented it.

I found many pages online that claimed you could see this town in one or two days. I disagree. There are many hiking routes, fishing, nearby gardens that I couldn’t see in our 4 days here. Not to mention I could probably spend weeks here just slacking-off and enjoying the cool, moody temperatures.

# Siquirres 

I like herping first and foremost, and while I did see some pretty lizards up in San Gerardo de Dota, its high elevations mean it’s not the most suitable place to find reptiles and amphibians. For this, we went to the [Guayacan Rainforest Reserve](https://cramphibian.com/), a private reserve founded by Brian Kubicki in the central slopes of the Caribbean. It was also conveniently halfway between San Gerardo de Dota and our final destination in the beaches of the Caribbean.

The very moment we arrived at the cabin, we found a beautiful Green and Black Poison Dart Frog near the front porch, and could hear plenty of Striped Rocket frogs, Strawberry Poison-dart frogs, dink frogs, among other species from the cabin. 

We took the first night to ourselves for non-guided exploration, and found an incredible number of species like the famous Red-eyed Tree Frogs, Hourglass Tree Frogs, Gliding Treefrogs, among others. 

The tour itself, however, provided us with the most wildlife by far. Brian Kubicki spotted many frogs like the Ghost Glass Frog, the Splendid Leaf Frog, and the Rufous-eyed brook frog which I would have never spotted due to them being hidden in paths through creeks, or high up in trees.

# Cahuita

Eventually we went to the Caribbean lowlands. The main goal for many herpers here is to find the beautiful Yellow-eyelash Viper. However, I also wanted to see the beautiful beaches the Caribbean has to offer, the stunning landscapes filled with palm-filled forests, and the many mammals that reside in this area.

We opted for traversing these trails without tours. Nonetheless, trails of Cahuita National Forest and Gandoca-Manzanillo National Forest were filled with spooky-sounding Howler Monkeys, Capuchin Monkeys, Raccoons, Coatis, and other mammals that weren’t difficult to spot. Moreover, my sister was especially good at spotting inconspicuous sloths resting high up in the trees. 

As for herping, many trees were dotted with stunning yellow-headed geckos, and ground-lizards and basilisks ran across the trails. We also saw a beautiful Vine Snake and a Hognose Pit Viper. We didn’t see the revered Yellow-eyelash Viper until the last day here, it was surprisingly difficult to find for such a colorful snake.

I’m writing this from Alajuela, getting ready to go back home tomorrow. All in all, I think this trip has been a success. I think I should go in similar adventures more often!
